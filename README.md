# MongoDBAtlas-IBM-AIML

# Background
This is a tutorial on how to use MongoDB Atlas with an example of integration with IBM Watson Visual Recognition API to create a event-driven model in Python.

## Technical Complexity
_Beginner_ to _Intermediate_ 

## Skills 
Familiarity with the following skill sets will help:
* Python 3
* HTML
* Basic JSON (will be covered in MongoDB introduction slides)


## Software required
* Modern web browser such as Chrome
  * Needed to access MongoDB Atlas, optional IBM Watson Access if you want to use your own API Key
* Optionally install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass) but this is not required

## Duration
_45 Minutes_

# Setup
## High Level Readme
* Setup a MongoDB Atlas Account
* Deploy a MongoDB Atlas M0 (free tier)
* Configure the free tier to create a username/password and an IP whitelist to allow access from anywhere
* Make note of the connection string for Python
* Create a Watson account
* Enable the Visual Recognition API
* Create a service on for the Visual Recognition API 
* Get the API key
* Install python, clone this github repo on to the host
* Configure the `FinishedSampleCode/settings.cfg` to have the Atlas connection string and API key in it
* Install any python requirements by running `pip install -r FinishedSampleCode/requirements.txt`
* Start the application using `python3 FinishedSampleCode/runner.py`
* Open a web browser to the localhost instance running on port 8088 over http


## Low Level Readme
* [Readme for configuring MongoDB Atlas](Guides/AtlasSetup.md)
* [Readme for writing this code from scratch](Guides/Code.md) or alternately just use the code in `FinishedSampleCode`
* [The guide for CRUD operations used during the instruction part of workshop](Guides/CRUD.md)


# Execution
* Start the application using `python3 FinishedSampleCode/runner.py`
* Open a web browser to localhost on port 8088 over http
* Insert a document into the database using MongoDB Compass or the new Data Explorer view in MongoDB Atlas which you can get to via the "Collections" button. The document you insert should have a field called `url` which is a full URL to an image.
* Alternately enter the URL into the web page directly and press the green "Insert" button
* Notice that in the web page and on the CLI output of the python script that it saw an insert
* Notice that after the insert, the change stream called the Watson Visual Recognition API to see what is in it. Refresh the Compass or Atlas Data Explorer view and see the rich data structure of the Watson Visual Recognition API.
